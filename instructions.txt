Django Case Study / Test Project:
Order Management for Philippine Foods Inc.
üëã Welcome to the Test Project
At Simple Data Tools (SDT), our work centers on rapid development, clear communication, and
a partner-first approach. We work with organizations in emerging markets that focus on the
triple bottom line, including initiatives related to climate, sustainability, food systems, youth
empowerment, women‚Äôs rights, and democracy. Many of our partners are growing quickly but
often lack full clarity on their technical requirements. As the lead developer, your job is to ask
the right questions, propose practical solutions, and collaborate closely with the partner to
iterate quickly until the app meets their needs. At SDT, every team member ‚Äî including
leadership ‚Äî is both a full-stack developer and client-facing.
In this test project, you‚Äôll be provided with an opportunity to experience what projects look and
feel like on a day-to-day basis. The below is a realistic simulation of how our projects usually
start. You'll act as the technical lead at SDT. Your ‚Äúclient‚Äù will be Philippine Foods Inc. (PFI), a
growing food distribution company expanding into Luzon and now looking to digitize their order
management workflows. Remember: our business model is based on a very small team that is
focused on very, very, very fast delivery, by balancing exceptional technical skills and good
communication / client support.
Project Overview
Build a lightweight Django web application to manage sales orders for Philippine Foods Inc.,
with the goal of launching a test version by the end of the week.
Core Technologies
‚Ä¢ Backend: Django (latest LTS)
‚Ä¢ Frontend: Django templates + built-in template engine (no React/Vue required)
‚Ä¢ Authentication: Django‚Äôs built-in user system, basic auth
‚Ä¢ API: REST API with JWT auth (for CRM/ERP integration)
‚Ä¢ Database: PostgreSQL
Note: Our business model prioritizes simple tech that solves problems and has a strong ROI,
not the latest buzzwords or framework trends. We often use Django because it is fast, simple,
secure, easy to integrate with data science libraries, and because LLM‚Äôs write near perfect
Django code. A successful test project will prioritize functionality, stability, security, and speed.
You are absolutely encouraged to use LLMs to help write your code, and because of that, we
would expect your code to be at or above a senior developer level in terms of structure and
quality.
Project Background
Philippine Foods Inc. (PFI) operates across several value chains -- poultry, pork, and beef. Each
has a unique set of products and SKUs. Their sales team consists of field Agents who:
‚Ä¢ Meet new leads
‚Ä¢ Convert leads into customers
‚Ä¢ Help customers place and track orders
PFI is now expanding into Luzon, and the CEO wants to launch a new order management app
to support this rollout. The goal is to start with a minimal but functional system and evolve it
rapidly with feedback.
The below conversation is how the project for one of our partners typically begins. You‚Äôll notice
our core values are reflected throughout the conversation. Specifically, we are always kind,
helpful, excited for new challenges, and a true partner ‚Äì helping our partner companies to feel
like technology is simple, low overhead, and driving their business forward. We always
emphasize and abide by the ‚ÄúSimple Data Tools Way‚Äù of building technology (start simple, focus
on business impact). You'll continue the conversation from here:
Matt [PFI]:
Hey, I was talking with the CEO this morning and we are thinking it‚Äôs probably the right time to
roll out a new app for order management since we are expanding into Luzon next month. It will
need to integrate with our CRM and ERP.
Cossette [SDT]:
Great! No problem at all ‚Äì we‚Äôve developed a lot of order tools before, and I agree the timing is
right, since many of the other apps we‚Äôve built together are more stable. This is also something
where we can start simple with the first version and grow it from there ‚Äì just like we like it‚Ä¶the
Simple Data Tools Way that we know works well.
Matt [PFI]:
Excellent. I‚Äôm not sure what requirements we‚Äôll need. I know we‚Äôll need agents to see their
customers for their sales region and then place orders.
Cossette [SDT]:
Yep, for sure. And they‚Äôll probably need to see the status of each order and order history since
customers are always calling them to ask. Maybe not in the first version, but later we can also
add dashboards and KPIs so agents can see their sales totals.
Matt [PFI]:
Yea‚Ä¶good call. Actually, now that I think about it, there will need to be a version the agents use
on mobile for placing the orders, then we‚Äôll need the office staff to have a web version for
making sure orders are fulfilled.
Cossette [SDT]:
Absolutely no problem at all. Let me frame out some of the basic setup we‚Äôll need and I‚Äôll follow
up this afternoon. Very much looking forward to this one‚Ä¶ I think we can get something out for
testing by the end of this week.
A few notes before you begin:
‚Ä¢ We always use Django for the backend. Since this is a fast-turnaround project, there‚Äôs
no need for React, Vue, or any frontend framework ‚Äî just stick with standard Django
templates and the built-in template engine. Likewise, we will not build a mobile app as
part of this test project. Just make sure the Django templates are set up to be mobile
friendly (we typically use Tailwind).
‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt use the Django admin panel. Instead, we build our own admin and internal
management views as part of the app itself.
‚Ä¢ You can use Django‚Äôs standard authentication system for this test (e.g. login/logout,
session-based or basic auth).
‚Ä¢ The app will eventually need to integrate with PFI‚Äôs CRM and ERP, so an API should be
available, ideally using JWT for authentication.
‚Ä¢ Throughout the project, feel free to ask any questions you need to clarify functionality or
requirements ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly how we work with real partners.
‚Ä¢ Lastly, make sure the app is set up cleanly and documented so that any other developer
can clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the project without needing to ask you
for help.
What to Submit
‚Ä¢ Your full Django project (via GitHub or zip)
‚Ä¢ At least one demo video of:
o What you built
o Assumptions you made
o What you‚Äôd do next if this were a real project
o Any questions you‚Äôd ask PFI as part of the next steps
Note: we use demo videos *a lot* in our projects as an async and efficient mechanism for
comms. Most developers on our team are filming multiple demo videos per day to show
progress, illustrate decision making, and lay out tradeoffs or next steps.
Tips for Success
‚Ä¢ Keep it real: this is not about fancy design or pixel-perfect CSS. Focus on usability and
workflow. Most of our apps have basic designs (often black and white color palettes) and
we never use preexisting templates with bloated CSS code. Any app we make just
needs to be intuitive and functional.
‚Ä¢ Prioritize communication: if something‚Äôs unclear, frame questions clearly and ask until
things are understood. As part of this test project, I will be intentionally acting like one of
our typical partners, responding in ways they often communicate. In many cases, you
will feel like I am being intentionally confusing or that I change my mind a lot. This is a
very normal part of our projects and our ability to navigate different communication styles
is part of why the work we do is so valuable J.
‚Ä¢ Work fast, work clean: clear code structure and basic documentation goes a long way.

0:15) Okay, hello, hi, how are you? (0:19) Hi, good evening. (0:22) Yeah, good evening. (0:23) Okay, first off, I am never late to meetings, (0:27) so I'm really, really sorry.
(0:30) It's okay. (0:31) Not that I need excuses, (0:32) but it was a really good investor friend of ours (0:37) put me in touch with another investor, (0:41) and it was one of these things (0:41) where it was scheduled for 30 minutes, (0:43) but it was clear this was like a really fast turnaround (0:47) scope of work that was gonna need to be put together. (0:50) So it's one of those when there's like a position of power, (0:52) it's really hard to be like, (0:53) I'm so sorry, I have to go and jump off the call, (0:58) because I was a little bit not the powerful one.
(1:02) So anyway, thank you, thank you. (1:04) But anyway, at the work that we do in Simple Data Tools, (1:07) we're like never late for meetings ever, (1:09) like never late for standups, never late for meetings. (1:12) So thank you for your flexibility on this one.
(1:15) And I'll make sure it doesn't happen again. (1:20) Okay, so you've had a chance to, (1:23) there's two things I wanted to cover with you today. (1:26) The first was to try to nail down something (1:29) in terms of a contract.
(1:32) I had a couple of follow-up questions for you as well, (1:35) because I looked at your profile in relation to the contract. (1:40) And then the second thing I wanted to cover (1:42) was just to get your questions answered in real time. (1:47) Again, more like a simulation (1:48) now that you've seen like the test project.
(1:51) And I wanted to talk a little bit more with you (1:54) about why the project is structured like that. (1:57) And how, again, how it kind of reflects (1:59) what we do as a company. (2:01) So I will take you through that just a little bit.
(2:03) And all of this is designed, (2:05) if you're still interested in this work, (2:07) all of this is designed to set you up (2:09) for success within this. (2:13) So the first thing is I noticed on your profile, (2:17) you've made a substantial amount of money (2:23) as a freelancer, quite a bit. (2:27) And so I wanted to find out a little bit, (2:30) one, congrats, that's awesome, very good.
(2:34) But I wanted to find out a little bit more (2:37) at a deeper level, (2:38) kind of what your longer term intentions are. (2:44) Is it to continue to be freelancing long-term (2:48) or would you ever be interested in coming (2:52) and working on a team like for a company? (2:56) And any answer is fine. (2:57) I just need to try to sort of understand (2:59) where you're at long-term, (3:01) because it'll help with the rest of the conversation.
(3:04) Yeah, right now my goal is to have really (3:09) a long-term project. (3:12) I am also okay with acquisition, (3:15) like really hard in a company. (3:19) Okay, okay, got it.
(3:21) But you've been freelancing for two years or so, (3:25) is that right? (3:26) Yeah. (3:26) And how did you begin with freelancing? (3:30) Did you just say, I'm tired of my big girl job? (3:35) That's what I did. (3:36) I just quit my big real job.
(3:39) And then according to my family, (3:41) I've been unemployed since, (3:44) even though I'm actually doing quite a bit of work, right? (3:46) But I just said, I don't quit my job, (3:48) I wanna do different things. (3:50) How did your freelancing start? (3:54) Yeah, the real reason is in my previous corporate company, (4:00) that I work on as a full-time developer, (4:04) the salary is a bit low compared to freelancing. (4:09) So that's why I decided to simultaneously (4:14) do full-time employment and freelance employment.
(4:18) And just recently, last January, 2025, (4:22) I decided to have a full-time freelance employment. (4:26) That's why I'm looking for a long-term project. (4:30) Okay, got it.
(4:31) Okay, and then so you, (4:35) are you doing the work yourself? (4:39) It's you individually, right? (4:40) It's not like you getting the work (4:43) and then giving it to other people, right? (4:46) Yes. (4:47) Okay. (4:48) Most of my projects is structured like that.
(4:51) But I mean, it's you. (4:53) So sometimes we run into circumstances (4:54) where like we may hire you as a freelancer, (4:58) but it's actually your two cousins (5:00) and then their brothers or their friends (5:03) that are doing the work. (5:06) It's actually you sitting down writing the code.
(5:10) Ah, yes. (5:10) Yeah, I can say, (5:12) I can't really trust another person to do my job. (5:15) That is the simple data tools way.
(5:17) I like that, taking initiative. (5:19) Okay. (5:19) All right.
(5:20) Very good. (5:20) Very cool. (5:21) So what my concern is, (5:24) which I forgot to mention from before, (5:27) is that we have a fixed budget for these test projects.
(5:32) And so the hourly rate is actually quite low. (5:35) We usually actually put people at $7 an hour, (5:38) which is way less than your profile rate. (5:41) And so my concern is that I don't wanna write you a contract.
(5:45) If you're interested in doing the test project, (5:48) I don't wanna write you a contract at a rate (5:50) that's much lower than what you've been getting (5:53) on your profile. (6:00) Because then, I don't know, (6:01) but if you're trying to build your profile, (6:05) somebody might see, okay, cool. (6:06) She worked for $20 an hour.
(6:08) She worked for $15 an hour. (6:09) And then cool, she worked for this little project for seven. (6:13) I'll send her an offer for five, right? (6:15) I don't know if that's how it works.
(6:17) But one of the things I'm trying, (6:19) one thing we always do with these test projects, (6:24) so it doesn't matter if you're good or you're bad, (6:27) I always give everyone five stars on the test project (6:33) because maybe you weren't a good fit for us. (6:36) Like maybe you weren't good enough skills (6:38) or maybe you didn't have the right personality. (6:40) But at a minimum, I want you to leave (6:43) with a stronger profile than when you started.
(6:46) And so part of that is, (6:47) is you'll always get another five star review, (6:51) even if we determine you're not a good fit, right? (6:54) So anyway, so you'll always benefit (6:56) by doing a test project with us, (6:58) but I don't want to hurt your profile in other ways. (7:02) So the other option that I have (7:03) is I can send you a fixed price contract (7:06) and we agree on kind of the number of hours (7:09) that it will take. (7:10) And then that way that people don't know (7:13) what your actual hourly rate is, if that makes sense.
(7:17) Oh, okay. (7:18) I'm fine with that. (7:19) Okay.
(7:20) Is that better? (7:22) Is that- (7:22) Yes. (7:23) Yeah, I'm fine with fixed price. (7:25) Okay.
(7:25) That's like a, (7:26) so we can just do like some type of fixed price. (7:28) It's a little different because it doesn't allow us that, (7:32) the hourly is actually better (7:33) because not only do you end up making more money overall, (7:37) but it can end up being a little bit more dynamic. (7:40) So I may need to adjust your scope just a little bit (7:45) because with the hourly, (7:46) we can really get into kind of a simulation, (7:49) like exactly like how we work, (7:52) but with fixed price, (7:52) we'll limit it to just a little bit more (7:55) of a near term scope and then a smaller number of hours.
(7:58) Okay. (8:00) That makes sense. (8:01) Okay.
(8:02) So let me try to figure out first what that looks like, (8:06) but let's get your questions answered first (8:09) so I can get all of this dialed in. (8:11) Okay. (8:13) Okay.
(8:17) Let me find, (8:18) let me open up your questions here really quick. (8:21) Okay. (8:21) Okay.
(8:21) I've got to go scroll way up. (8:26) Okay. (8:26) You sent me a couple of questions.
(8:29) Excellent. (8:30) Now, remember, (8:30) you read the test case study, right? (8:34) Yes. (8:35) Okay.
(8:36) And I am, (8:38) I'm going to respond though, (8:39) as if I'm a non-tech executive at the, (8:44) what did we call our fictitious company? (8:46) PFI, right? (8:48) Philippine Foods Incorporated. (8:49) Yes. (8:51) Yeah.
(8:51) I'll show you an example kind of (8:53) of what our projects look like, (8:54) but let me just answer your questions here. (8:57) So since, (8:58) so I'm not going to answer, (8:59) I'm going to not answer from a tech perspective. (9:01) I'll answer as if I'm an executive leading operations.
(9:05) So you said, (9:06) since we're expanding into Luzon, (9:08) are we only focusing on Luzon customers and agents (9:10) for the first version? (9:13) No, we would want the app to work across all locations (9:20) because we may not even roll this out to Luzon at first. (9:24) I just know that once we roll it out to Luzon, (9:27) we're going to need, (9:28) we're going to need to have tech behind it. (9:30) Like we're not going to be able to manage it (9:31) without technology.
(9:34) How do we define regions within Luzon by province, (9:38) by city, (9:38) or by another structure? (9:40) So we follow a, (9:42) we follow the typical structure with the like province, (9:46) the regions, (9:47) the province, (9:47) the barangays. (9:49) And so we will try to stick to the kind of official (9:52) barangays and the province and the regions, (9:57) which makes it a lot easier. (9:59) With that, (10:00) you'll need to find a list on the internet though, (10:04) of what those actually look like.
(10:06) Will all agents only see customers in their assigned regions (10:09) or should they see customers from other areas too? (10:12) So that's a really good question. (10:15) Our agents should only see their own customers (10:18) within the region that they have been assigned. (10:22) But what's interesting, (10:24) and I'll give you a little tip, (10:25) is our agents are sometimes assigned (10:29) to more than one region.
(10:31) So most agents are just assigned to one region, (10:34) but sometimes an agent may have two, (10:37) if they're really good, (10:38) or the region is smaller, (10:40) or if they've been at the company for a long time. (10:44) Does that make sense? (10:46) Okay. (10:47) All right.
(10:48) Can agents add new customers? (10:50) Absolutely. (10:51) Edit customer details? (10:52) Absolutely. (10:53) Yes.
(10:53) Yes. (10:54) For both of those. (10:55) Should there be role-based access? (10:57) Agents only place orders.
(10:59) Office staff can update the statuses. (11:01) Absolutely. (11:02) Exactly.
(11:03) So what happens is, (11:04) is that the agents will place the orders (11:07) and then the back office staff will mark them as accepted. (11:11) Then they'll mark them as dispatched. (11:13) Then they'll mark them as delivered.
(11:16) That make sense? (11:18) Okay. (11:19) So you have pending, fulfilled, canceled, and delivered. (11:22) Great call.
(11:23) Pending would be when it first comes in. (11:26) Accepted or approved is when it's been reviewed. (11:30) Then it would be dispatched.
(11:32) Then it would be delivered. (11:34) And once it's delivered, it's fulfilled. (11:36) And I think that's a great idea to have canceled.
(11:39) That's fantastic as well. (11:40) Because we may reject or cancel an order. (11:44) Can agents modify or cancel orders after they are placed? (11:49) Agents can modify an order if it's still been pending.
(11:53) But once it's accepted, (11:55) once it's been accepted, (11:59) at that point it may be dispatched or whatever (12:02) so they can't edit and change it from there. (12:04) But if it's still pending, they can cancel it, (12:06) they can change the details, (12:08) anything like that within that status. (12:10) Okay? (12:11) Okay.
(12:13) All right. (12:13) Any other questions? (12:16) Project-wise, I think that's all the questions I've had. (12:21) But I have a question about, (12:25) does you have a scoring system (12:29) to identify the success of this test project? (12:37) We do not.
(12:38) Okay. (12:39) I'm gonna show you what we're getting (12:41) at the heart of right now. (12:44) So I am less concerned about your code (12:52) because with LLMs and artificial intelligence now, right? (12:57) As I outlined in the test project, (12:59) I would expect me and I would expect you (13:02) to be writing essentially senior developer level code.
(13:07) Right? (13:07) Because LLMs can really write Django code (13:11) really, really well. (13:12) Yeah? (13:13) And almost that it like, (13:16) chat GPT almost does the next step. (13:19) It's like you build out a view (13:20) and they're like, do you want me to build out the template? (13:22) And I'm like, yes.
(13:23) And then they're like, now that you have the template, (13:25) do you want me to build out the form? (13:28) And I'm like, yes. (13:30) Right? (13:30) Now that you've built out the form, (13:31) do you want me to add this to the admin panel? (13:34) Yes. (13:35) Like, thank you.
(13:36) Thank you. (13:36) Thank you. (13:37) Right? (13:37) I mean, it's wild.
(13:39) Right? (13:40) And so anyway, so that's great. (13:43) But what we're looking for are two things. (13:47) Do you fit really well with our core values? (13:51) Are you excited, passionate about tech? (13:54) Do you like to think through problems (13:55) and come up with really good ideas? (13:57) Right? (13:58) And then we're looking for, (13:59) if you're able to operate in the environment (14:03) that we operate in, (14:04) which is what I want to give you some previews into.
(14:09) And so the success or the failure is just, (14:13) does this look like something you want to do long-term? (14:16) Does it look like something you can do, (14:18) whatever, long-term? (14:20) And let me give you just a quick example (14:21) of what our life looks like on a daily basis. (14:25) Okay? (14:27) I'm going to share my screen. (14:29) All right? (14:29) Okay.
(14:31) Okay. (14:31) All right. (14:33) So remember, as you probably read from our thing, (14:36) our business model has to do with being a really small team (14:40) that is very elite, exceptional delivery, (14:44) very, very fast.
(14:46) Okay? (14:46) And so this is an example, actually, truthfully, (14:49) this is an example from yesterday (14:51) from a company that we onboarded just one week ago. (14:56) Okay? (14:56) So this is a company, very high impact fish farm (15:01) that's within Kenya, that's working with a lot of farmers. (15:04) You can see here that this was yesterday.
(15:06) We started building their app on Friday of last week. (15:12) Okay? (15:12) This was yesterday, which was Tuesday. (15:16) And today we deployed the first version of the app.
(15:20) They're doing training and they're doing data collection. (15:22) Now, this example here that we're looking at (15:25) is going to be for AppSheet. (15:27) So it's a low code, no code builder tool.
(15:31) But what you're going to see is the dynamics (15:33) of how we actually do requirements. (15:35) And it's the reason that we have the test project (15:38) set up in the way that it is. (15:40) Okay? (15:41) So one of the contacts who does operations at the company (15:45) said, can we add an expected delivery date field (15:48) to the order? (15:50) The delivery date field could be a range.
(15:52) It could be the same day. (15:53) It may be the next day. (15:55) Made a comment about the geolocation, (15:59) like province, region, barangay type of hierarchy.
(16:03) And then also said, (16:04) it's not clear to me how the delivery flow is set up. (16:08) I can see the delivery status report, (16:09) but I don't see the delivery module. (16:11) And then also here's some legacy data.
(16:13) Okay? (16:14) All sent over WhatsApp. (16:15) And again, this came in at 11.35 a.m. yesterday morning. (16:20) Right? (16:21) So 11.35 a.m. Philippines time yesterday morning.
(16:24) So I respond back, absolutely. (16:26) Super easy to build the date field. (16:28) I'll also follow up with the delivery workflow.
(16:32) And along with that, add in geo-coordinates. (16:35) So this is an example of how requirements often come to us. (16:39) We have an initial version of the app.
(16:41) They're on it. (16:42) They're playing with it. (16:43) And they're like, ah, let's add delivery date.
(16:45) Ah, let's add geo-coordinates. (16:46) Let's add this. (16:47) Right? (16:48) And we're like, absolutely.
(16:49) Excellent. (16:50) And what you'll see is, (16:51) what you'll see here within the screen somewhere is, (16:55) I'll add this in and follow up this afternoon. (16:58) Because this is how we operate.
(17:00) Right? (17:01) And so what I'm also going to do though in this case, (17:04) which is a different from the dynamic (17:05) that you may be used to, (17:08) is a lot of times technology providers will say, (17:11) tell me what to build and I'll go build it. (17:15) But we don't operate like that at all. (17:17) The way we operate is, (17:19) let me show you some really cool ideas (17:22) for what you can build.
(17:23) We're already always trying to think ahead (17:27) of what they're going to need (17:28) from a business perspective to scale, (17:30) from an analytics perspective, (17:32) from a workflow perspective, (17:34) from an optimization perspective. (17:36) And by the way, you're already doing that. (17:39) Your question about agents being assigned to regions, (17:43) very, very, very insightful, very, very good.
(17:47) Right? (17:47) That's the kind of thing that we want to try to get ahead of (17:50) is like, wait a minute. (17:51) Okay? (17:51) And so here's an example of me saying, (17:54) this is kind of an idea of what we can build, (17:56) giving them ideas for things (17:58) that they can put in their head. (17:59) And then again, emphasizing, (18:02) I'll follow back up this afternoon (18:03) once the changes are implemented, (18:04) but keep sending over ideas as you review, no limits.
(18:08) Because this is what we actually want people to do (18:11) because watch what happens on the next screen. (18:13) The CEO and the operations person (18:17) start going back and forth (18:19) to discuss their own requirements. (18:22) So it would be the equivalent of something like this.
(18:24) Let's say you're the developer at Simple Data Tools (18:27) and I'm the CEO at PFI, right? (18:32) And then there's David who does operations. (18:36) And you said, (18:37) do we need to have customers assigned or agents, (18:41) customers shown for an agent (18:43) for regions they're assigned to? (18:46) What actually happens on a day-to-day basis with us (18:49) is I, if I'm the CEO of PFI, (18:51) I would be like, David, (18:53) our agents are assigned to regions, right? (18:56) And then David would say, yes. (18:59) And actually they're sometimes assigned (19:01) to more than one region.
(19:03) And then I would be like, oh, okay, well, wait a minute. (19:06) Then we need to make sure that this app (19:08) is going to assign agents to regions (19:11) and allow us to assign more than one agent to a region. (19:15) And so what you're actually seeing on the screen, (19:18) which is the dynamic that we want to create (19:21) is they're improving their operations (19:26) and they're discussing their requirements in real time.
(19:29) And as the requirements are evolving, (19:31) we're building alongside it, right? (19:34) And so apps come together really quickly. (19:36) And so I gave, now this is another example (19:38) where we're not just saying, (19:42) tell me what to build and I'll build it. (19:43) We're giving suggestions.
(19:45) We're saying, okay, well, we could keep it like this, (19:47) but I think what we'll do is we'll have it auto-populate (19:50) and then we'll do X, Y, and Z. (19:52) And this is gonna be a really good path forward (19:53) for you for the first version, right? (19:55) And then of course, later that night, as expected, (19:59) which is afternoon East Africa time, (20:02) I said, I'll follow up with a demo video (20:05) over viewing the changes, which I sent below this. (20:08) And then we pushed out a bunch of new changes, (20:10) added segments, added customer types, (20:13) added geo-coordinates, cleaned up the geo-levels (20:15) and a bunch of stuff. (20:16) And these updates float out today.
(20:19) This morning, more updates float out. (20:22) Later this afternoon, more updates from Eulika, (20:26) a different developer, float out. (20:27) And this is how we're actually like building apps (20:30) or whatever, yeah? (20:31) And so that's the reason why, (20:33) that gives you an idea of what it looks like (20:35) on a day-to-day basis, (20:37) but that's the reason why there's no right or wrong answer (20:42) in this test project, right? (20:44) What we wanna see is that if you're given (20:47) a very open-ended project, (20:49) which is build an order tool, right? (20:52) Are you gonna ask the right questions (20:53) that would allow us to build really fast (20:56) without requirements or excessive documentation (20:59) and go from zero to an app in just a few days.
(21:03) Does that make sense? (21:05) Yeah. (21:07) So based on the requirements that we had discussed (21:11) and all the questions that was answered, (21:14) I plan to deliver the test project (21:17) in three focus development days (21:21) plus I need a one-day buffer. (21:26) So you need four.
Is that okay with you? (21:28) You need four days. (21:30) Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. (21:34) So you need four days.
(21:37) So you need 32 hours, yes? (21:42) That's right. (21:43) Okay, 32 hours to complete the test project, yeah? (21:50) Okay, that sounds good. (21:52) Now you can ask me, (21:54) obviously you can ask me questions throughout, right? (21:57) Throughout the project.
(22:00) But if we, again, 32 times budget, (22:05) if I give you a budget of $250, (22:09) can you do it for that, right? (22:12) For this? (22:14) Yeah, sure. (22:15) Okay. I'm okay with it.
(22:16) I'm not trying to go super low on you. (22:19) We actually treat people really, really fairly. (22:21) It's just that I have to put this, (22:22) I have a budget for testing people (22:27) and getting them in the door.
(22:28) So if I send you just flat rate 250 Django app for orders, (22:32) right, you can get it done. (22:35) Does that work? (22:36) Yeah. (22:37) Okay, good.
(22:38) We're actually, one of the reasons (22:41) if this ends up working out long-term, (22:44) one of the things is we're very, very big (22:47) on paying above market rates (22:51) for people who are full-time and long-term. (22:54) And so the good thing is, (22:56) for most people who have been freelancing, (23:00) they say, well, there's no point in me freelancing anymore (23:02) because I can work full-time on this, (23:05) on a lot of really interesting projects, (23:07) and I'm gonna make more than I would have been (23:09) if I was freelancing. (23:11) So it's good.
(23:12) So I don't want to give you the impression (23:13) that we're looking for cheap offshore labor (23:17) or anything like that. (23:18) It's not like that. (23:19) I just need to get it within a budget of our test projects.
(23:23) Okay. (23:23) I totally understand that. (23:25) Yeah.
Okay, good. (23:25) All right. (23:27) Okay, so I can send that to you right away, (23:30) but what I'm trying to get you from this example, (23:34) I can't tell if you're shy or if you're nervous (23:38) or something like that, (23:41) but don't overthink this and don't, (23:45) it doesn't have to be so formal, right? (23:48) Like it doesn't have to be like, thank you, Sir Matt.
(23:51) Here's my questions, 15 questions. (23:53) Like if you're building, right? (23:54) And you're like, just like you saw by chat, (23:57) if I was building and I was like, wait, hi, quick question. (24:03) Do we ever have agents map to more than one region, right? (24:07) And then they're gonna follow back up (24:08) and they're gonna be like, yeah, that happens sometimes.
(24:10) I'm like, cool, thank you. (24:11) And then keep building, right? (24:13) So use it as a dynamic experience (24:18) because that's exactly what it would be (24:20) if we were building tools for partners (24:23) or we were building internal tools, okay? (24:26) Not sure. (24:27) So don't be shy or don't feel intimidated, (24:33) I guess, if that works.
(24:36) Yeah, along the way, I might have additional questions. (24:40) So I'll ping you in the chat. (24:42) You, wait, along the way, (24:44) you should have additional questions (24:46) and absolutely ping me in the chat (24:48) and I'll respond back to keep you moving.
(24:52) That sounds good. (24:55) What time are you usually online? (24:59) I am online from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. Philippines time (25:08) every day, including Saturday and Sunday. (25:12) Oh, okay.
(25:13) There is no time. (25:14) That's quite. (25:15) There is no time that you will.
(25:18) Okay. (25:19) Yeah, yeah. (25:21) Okay, how are you feeling overall? (25:24) Are you feeling good? (25:27) Yep, I am feeling excited with this new project.
(25:31) It's like a new example project for me. (25:36) Usually my projects before were related to (25:44) like Pixel Perfect CSS or something like that. (25:48) We don't do that.
(25:49) Yeah, it's just focusing really on the functionality. (25:54) So I think it really suits to my values. (25:59) I want it to be suited to your values.
(26:03) I want you also to know, okay, (26:08) that I'm leaving this one open-ended. (26:10) But when you build real projects for us, (26:13) you start with a template, (26:16) like you start with a Django template project (26:18) where like 90% of the stuff's already built. (26:22) API is already there.
(26:24) Login screen's already there. (26:25) Authentication's already there. (26:27) Model's already there, whatever, right? (26:30) And as you probably read in the documentation, (26:33) but I'll share my screen.
(26:35) Where is it? (26:36) Every single app that we build looks like this. (26:42) Every single app. (26:45) We don't do anything with the interface (26:48) because we build simple data tools that solve problems.
(26:53) And what we found is that the businesses that we work for, (26:55) they don't care if it's black, if it's blue, (26:58) if it's green, if it's white, they don't care. (27:01) The only thing they care about is that it works (27:04) and it's fast, right? (27:07) Works fast and cheap. (27:08) So if you're somebody, for me personally, (27:11) and maybe we do have these same values, (27:13) for me personally, I don't have time (27:15) to sit around and try to center a div (27:16) on a screen for five hours.
(27:18) I don't have time for that. (27:20) And thankfully, ChatGPT is really good (27:23) at Tailwind and Bootstrap. (27:24) So most of the time it can do it for us good enough.
(27:27) What we focus on, which is what you wanna focus on here (27:30) in this project, is building a really cool order tool (27:33) that a business could use. (27:35) That's it. (27:36) That's all you need to focus on.
(27:38) So I'm not gonna judge you based on design. (27:43) The only design that we do is enough to make it (27:47) understandable and intuitive to the user. (27:50) And that's it.
(27:51) That's all. (27:53) Yeah, that's great. (27:54) Easy.
(27:55) Okay. (27:56) And how are you... (27:57) One last question again, not to, (27:59) since we're at 30 minutes, (28:00) but how are you feeling about our core values as a company? (28:04) They are very important to us. (28:06) Do they align with you? (28:09) Yeah, absolutely.
(28:15) I'm sorry. (28:16) Did you say something? (28:18) That's all. (28:19) I just wanted to know.
(28:20) Yeah. (28:21) For me, I really resonate with SDT's core values, (28:26) especially the emphasis on fast delivery (28:29) and clear communication, (28:31) especially the practicality of the solutions. (28:36) Yeah.
(28:36) Good. (28:37) Okay. (28:39) Excellent.
(28:40) Go forth. (28:41) I'm sending you a contract now. (28:42) Okay? (28:43) I am here.
(28:44) I'm here to support. (28:47) Okay? (28:48) You don't have to prove anything. (28:51) If you have a question, I'm here to support.
(28:53) Pretend like I'm your manager or your colleague (28:56) or your teammate throughout this process. (28:58) Okay? (28:59) Don't be shy. (29:00) No stupid questions.
(29:02) No silly, like, inquiries. (29:05) Okay? (29:06) Okay. (29:07) Yeah, that's good.
(29:08) All right, cool. (29:09) Because this is also a chance for you to get used to me (29:11) and understand what it's like to work with me as well. (29:14) Okay? (29:17) Yeah, thank you.
(29:18) All right, let me know if you need anything (29:20) and have a good evening. (29:23) Okay, see you. (29:24) See you, bye.
